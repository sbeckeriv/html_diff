HTML DIFFING

Inspired by https://github.com/aha-app/track_changes diff html changes with new markup.


Server

Server runs with a JSON response and an html form view that displays the results. Form has some encoding issues
that are not present in the JSON.

> cargo run --release

```
curl -X POST -d '{"old":"<span>g the ‘why’, ‘what,’</span>", "current":"<span>g the ‘whys’, ‘whats,’</span>"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -vvvv 127.0.0.1:8000/diff
```
